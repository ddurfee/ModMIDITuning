This program is now called "Temperament Studio" and is in the TemperamentStudio repository.

Anything in this repository is outdated....



This repository contains a Java application which can change 
the tuning of a MIDI file.  One possible use is to hear
what a piece of music would sound like on a historical
instrument which used a tuning scheme different from the
standard equal temperament scale widely used today.

The repository also contains several midi files that can
be used to get started with this program.
